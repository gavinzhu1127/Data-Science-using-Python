3. open command window to run the following command in order to install a few more python packages
    - *conda install -c anaconda seaborn* 
    - *conda install -c plotly plotly*
    - *conda install -c conda-forge nodejs*
    - *conda install python-graphviz* 
4. run the following command to install a few more Jupyterlab extension
    - *jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/toc*
    - *jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension*   
5. after install you can click Anaconda Navigator to launch Jupyterlab
